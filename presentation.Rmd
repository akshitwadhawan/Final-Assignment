# Introduction

- This project looks at how different factors like age, sex, and location might influence the kinds of offences people commit and the sentences they receive. By looking at the patterns in the data, we can get a sense of whether these factors might actually help us predict future crime trends, and how their influence seems to shift over time.

---

# Data Overview

- This investigation draws on data from the Offender Management Statistics Quarterly: January to March 2023, published by the Ministry of Justice. The dataset offers detailed records on people entering, leaving, or serving sentences within the criminal justice system in England and Wales, giving a clear picture of how individuals move through the system.
- Our main variables after cleaning includes:
```{r, echo = FALSE, results = 'asis'}
Var_table <- data.frame(
  Variable = c("", "", ""),
  Type = c("", "", ""),
  Description = c("", "", "")
)

knitr::kable(Var_table)
```
These variables allow us to explore how age, sex, offence type, location, and sentence length relate to violent crime. Using official government data ensures the analysis is reliable and nationally representative.
---

#Exploratory statistics

The statistics suggest that offence type is influenced by several key variables:
- Age, this shows a strong effect, with younger offenders more likely to be involved in certain violent or high-risk offences, while older groups tend to appear more often in less impulsive or lower-severity categories. 

- Sex, this doesn’t seem to be major predictor, although overall males committed more crimes but the rate of violent versus non-violent is around the same. 

- Together, these variables indicate that offence type is not random but closely linked to demographic and contextual factors, with age showing the strongest influence in the data.

Write about what the statistics suggests about offence type being influenced by variables, and which variables show a strong influence

```{r, echo = FALSE}

data <- read_excel("data/Copy of Punishments.xlsx")

#having to set the data into the different age categories

data <- data %>%
  mutate(
    `Age group` = factor(`Age group`, 
                         levels = c("15 - 17", "18 - 20", "21 - 24", "25 - 29",
                                    "30 - 39", "40 - 49", "50 - 59", "60 - 69", "70 and over")),
    `Predominant function of establishment` = factor(`Predominant function of establishment`)
  )

#making the graph having to make it into count plot so the frequency can be determined

ggplot(data,
       aes(
    x = `Age group`,
    y = `Predominant function of establishment`
)) +
    geom_count(color="Green", alpha = 0.7) +
    scale_size_area(max_size = 20) +
    labs(
        title = "Frequency of Establishment Function by Age Group",
        x = "Age group",
        y = "Predominant function of establishment",
        size = "Count"
    ) +
    theme_minimal()+ 
  theme( axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1) 
         )

#- Use `---` to separate slides and `--` for incremental builds


#- (describe what each bar plot shows in terms of changing proportion of violent to non-violent crimes, because sex doesnt have any change say why we discount it going forward in the investigation)

```
As you can see in this count plot it is clear that with the exception of youth institutions all the different establishments showed the highest number of inhabitants with individuals aged 30-39.

.pull-right[
```{r, echo = FALSE}
data$`No of days` <- as.numeric(data$`No of days`)

data %>%
  group_by(`Age group`) %>%
  summarise(
    mean_days = mean(`No of days`, na.rm = TRUE),
    median_days = median(`No of days`, na.rm = TRUE),
    total_days = sum(`No of days`, na.rm = TRUE)
  )
```

This table highlights the disparity in the amount of time each age groups are spending in these establishments ]

# Layouts

You can use plain text

- or bullet points

.pull-left[
or text in two columns $^*$
]
.pull-right[
- like
- this
]

.footnote[
[*] And add footnotes
]

# Code/ table example

.pull-right[
```{r table, echo = FALSE}
# table, hiding the code with echo = FALSE
data_type_sex <- data_type %>%
  select(offence_type, sex) %>%

# Tables

If you want to generate a table, make sure it is in the HTML format (instead of Markdown or other formats), e.g.,

```{r iris-table, echo = FALSE}
kable(head(iris), format = "html")
```

---

# Images

```{r castle, echo = FALSE, out.width = "55%", fig.align = "center", fig.cap = "Image credit: Photo by Jörg Angeli on Unsplash."}
include_graphics("img/edinburgh-castle.jpg")
```

Or you can also include a full page image. See next slide.

# Math Expressions

You can write LaTeX math expressions inside a pair of dollar signs, e.g. &#36;\alpha+\beta$ renders $\alpha+\beta$. You can use the display style with double dollar signs:

```
$$\bar{X}=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^nX_i$$
```

$$\bar{X}=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^nX_i$$

Limitations:

1. The source code of a LaTeX math expression must be in one line, unless it is inside a pair of double dollar signs, in which case the starting `$$` must appear in the very beginning of a line, followed immediately by a non-space character, and the ending `$$` must be at the end of a line, led by a non-space character;

1. There should not be spaces after the opening `$` or before the closing `$`.

1. Math does not work on the title slide (see [#61](https://github.com/yihui/xaringan/issues/61) for a workaround).
